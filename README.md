# CS 422 - Data Mining

## Course Overview

CS 422 provides an introductory yet comprehensive exploration of data mining concepts and techniques. The course focuses on analyzing large datasets to discover meaningful patterns and knowledge. Core topics include market basket analysis, nearest neighbor search, decision trees, clustering, and more.

Students gain practical experience implementing these techniques, building a strong foundation in data-driven problem-solving. The course leverages industry-standard tools such as Python’s scientific stack (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib), Jupyter notebooks, and big data frameworks like Spark and Hadoop, emphasizing scalable data analytics.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the motivations and real-world applications of data mining.
- Perform data preprocessing to clean and prepare datasets effectively.
- Implement and analyze key data mining algorithms such as Apriori, FP-Growth, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, K-Means, and DBSCAN.
- Address scalability challenges and apply distributed computing methods for large datasets.
- Evaluate models rigorously, understand biases, and consider ethical implications.
- Demonstrate hands-on skills through programming assignments, quizzes, and a semester-long project.
